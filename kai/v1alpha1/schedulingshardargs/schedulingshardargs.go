// (kai.scheduler/v1 SchedulingShard). These keys are KAI scheduler CLI flag
// names; KAI does not export them, so they are mirrored here as the accepted
// --scheduling-shard-args contract. It lives beside the KAI NodePool CRD types so the
// contract and the CRD migrate together. Producers (the enterprise go-operator,
// and the open-source Helm chart) must use these keys so the values land on the
// flags the KAI scheduler actually reads.
